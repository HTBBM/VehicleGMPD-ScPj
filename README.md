# Software Requirements

### Can boot a Esp32 board on your Ide
* If you are working with Arduino Ide you only need to put the this link on preferences: `https://github.com/HTBBM/VehicleGMPD-ScPj/edit/main/README.md` and select your `esp32 board`.

### The "Esp32 BLE Gamepad" Library
To simulate the controller we uses this [ESP32-BLE-Gamepad](https://github.com/lemmingDev/ESP32-BLE-Gamepad) library. On that you can simulate your esp32 like a gamepad on multiple devices (Like Windows, Linux, Android...).
* [Library Link](https://docs.arduino.cc/libraries/liquidcrystal-i2c/)
> In this project we will work on Windows.

### "LiquidCrystal I2C" Library
* [Library Link](https://docs.arduino.cc/libraries/liquidcrystal-i2c/)
> This I2C not is the most important thing on the project and whether you cant get a LCD, don't worry about him, this not will turn your experience to a bad experience.

# Hardware Requirements
